Duplication detection works by loading a processed address list from file and check duplicates
before sending. After each run, updated processed list will be saved to another file in case
of exceptions caused data missing. You might want to config the processedListFile and the
processedListUpdateFile to the same file for convenience during multiple runs.

    mv config.sample.js config.js

    npm install

    npm run process
